msgid "There are two primary formats for BoF sessions.  The first is an informal or roundtable discussion session.  The second is a moderated panel discussion, inviting substantial contributions from the audience.  For both of these types of discussions, however, one or two moderators and organizers are necessary to ensure that the discussion is both guided and cohesive.  Moderators are encouraged to either identify participants that will attend (for roundtable or more informal BoFs and to have an estimate on numbers) or identify panelists in advance for panelist discussions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:21
msgid "For panelist discussions, moderators should prepare questions in advance, be prepared to keep the BoF moving along, and enable questions and answers from the audience.  Successful topics in the past have included broad discussions of reproducibility, greater inclusion of women in scientific computing, the advancement of Python within different scientific domains, future directions for scientific Python, and educational programs in Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:28
msgid "For informal or roundtable BoFs, having a list of topics beforehand can be useful, but sometimes moderators have found with a small group, that a simple poll of the attendees on discussion topics can work. Although, the moderator should probably have a backup set of topics as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:33
msgid "Another potential class of topics, which fits into both styles of BoF, is to hold a \"state of the project\" BoF.

Additionally, always make it very clear when you are acting as the \"Communications Chair\" on behalf of the conference rather than as an individual.  People you don't know will nominally defer to the conference authority as long as they feel that their grievances are being heard (your job).  Your friends and fellow organizers will understand that they are putting you in an uncomfortable situation that they themselves don't wish to have.  By listening and making your role clear, you should be able to diffuse and resolve most sensitive topics."
