msgid "In less than two months you will be teaching a hopefully awesome tutorial for an audience that is eager to learn and to interact. This year we expect to have a record in attendance, so you should be prepared to cope with a potentially large number of people in your classroom. In order to help you having success in your endeavor, we have listed some points for your consideration during the preparation of your materials."

msgid "All installation steps need to be done well *BEFORE* the tutorial to ensure success. Tutor need to post detailed installation instructions at least *2 weeks* before as well as an installation testing script. We will contact the students informing them that they need to make sure they are setup for the tutorial before the tutorial start as no installation time will be scheduled during the tutorial. They will be encouraged to visit the tutorial page to find your material and come to the class with their computer already setup."

msgid "People expect you to *teach* them, independently on how much you know about the subject. So avoid the temptation to explain too many different things, and rather *focus* on a few, that is, the ones that you consider are more *fundamental*."

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/mailings/tutorials_welcome_tutors.rst:29
msgid "You should try to make people to *think*, and most specially, to *type*. Better than having too many exercises, it is generally better to come with fewer that let people more time to think. Also, making the implementation of the solutions for exercises short will avoid unnecessary stress and will allow more exploratory paths for students."

msgid "Expect a wide range of abilities in the students, even in intermediate and advanced.  This inevitably leads to new folks complaining the material is to advanced and vice versa.  One way to deal with this is to have a couple of groups of exercises, e.g., introductory, intermediate, and advanced."

msgid "Don't depend on internet access too much.  While we don't expect problems, the worst thing is to expect everyone coding on your IPython notebook server in the cloud and no one can get to it. In fact, we encourage you to bring a few usb's with your materials that can be passed around if folks can't connect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/mailings/tutorials_welcome_tutors.rst:48
msgid "Encourage *group creation* (groups of two, three or four people) so that discussions can appear easily. That reinforces the learning experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/mailings/tutorials_welcome_tutors.rst:52
msgid "It is always sane to plan your tutorial well ahead of time. Make sure that you can have a preliminary version of your materials ready *2 weeks* before your tutorial, so that you can make them available (without the solutions, of course!) to the students prior to the tutorial."

msgid "If you have further questions on any of these points, please feel free to send them to this mailing list: tutors2013@scipy.org.  The tutorial chairs will try to help you as much as we can, and the other tutors in the list may want to help each other too."

msgid "Finally, it is important to remember that teaching is an art: students want to learn, but they also want to feel as if they have some control over themselves. Try to put your knowledge at work and make them learn things that they feel they can control. If you achieve this, your tutorial will be a very rewarding experience, for them, but specially for you."
