msgid "This year SciPy has two topical themes in addition to a general track: Machine Learning and Tools for Reproducibility. Your applications of machine learning in science would help focus our conference around a topic that is becoming more prevalent.  We expect to have two more keynotes, one on machine learning tools in Python and another on reproducibility tools, but the invitations are still pending.  On a personal note, **X**."
