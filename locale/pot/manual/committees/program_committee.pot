msgid "Mini-symposium chairs should be recruited as soon as possible.  The mini-symposium address scientific python in a domain-specific sub-community. It is the mini-symposium chair's role to encourage participation from their community, select talks for the session, and organize the content of the session.  The content and organization of the session is left up to the discretion of the mini-symposium chair.  In the past, they have consisted of a series of talks, panel discussion, \"state of the community\", or a combination of the above.  Since a large amount of growth of the conference comes from the recruitment in these sub-domains, it is important to get the mini-symposium chair engaged early on."

The themes should be selected based on feedback from the community and the interests of the chairs. Good themes are related to \"what's hot\", have broad appeal, and have a strong Python community.  The mini-symposium themes are determined by the domain those willing to serve as mini-syposium chairs.  Four to five mini-symposia have been held per-conference in the past."

Special circumstances, such a balance between tracks, more than one talk by the same author, and the comments by the reviewers are only taken into account one the schedule starts to fill up.  Posters are similarly selected from the ranked scores."
