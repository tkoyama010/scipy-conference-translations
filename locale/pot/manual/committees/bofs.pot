msgid "The idea behind a Birds of a Feather session is to promote community growth through informal discussion or relaxed panel discussion with substantial audience participation.  At SciPy, we've had success organizing BoFs to enable attendees interested in topics and projects to gather for discussion."

msgid "Format and Content"
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:12
msgid "There are two primary formats for BoF sessions.  The first is an informal or roundtable discussion session.  The second is a moderated panel discussion, inviting substantial contributions from the audience.  For both of these types of discussions, however, one or two moderators and organizers are necessary to ensure that the discussion is both guided and cohesive.  Moderators are encouraged to either identify participants that will attend (for roundtable or more informal BoFs and to have an estimate on numbers) or identify panelists in advance for panelist discussions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:21
msgid "For panelist discussions, moderators should prepare questions in advance, be prepared to keep the BoF moving along, and enable questions and answers from the audience.  Successful topics in the past have included broad discussions of reproducibility, greater inclusion of women in scientific computing, the advancement of Python within different scientific domains, future directions for scientific Python, and educational programs in Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:28
msgid "For informal or roundtable BoFs, having a list of topics beforehand can be useful, but sometimes moderators have found with a small group, that a simple poll of the attendees on discussion topics can work. Although, the moderator should probably have a backup set of topics as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/committees/bofs.rst:33
msgid "Another potential class of topics, which fits into both styles of BoF, is to hold a \"state of the project\" BoF.  This can include discussions of future directions for the project, clearing out of project business (i.e., proposals for enhancement), advocacy efforts, and general discussion of the project."

Since the program cannot be changed once printed, it was confusing to many attendees to see specific BoFs in the program when they may have been moved around.  In the future it may be wise get the BoF schedule out early enough so any corrections can be made before the schedule is printed."

These include netcdf/CF, OPeNDAP, THREDDS catalogs, and OGC stack (CSW, WFS, SOS, SensorML, WaterML 2.0, etc), the first generation CUAHSI HIS stack (WOF & WaterML 1.x), WQX, and others.
