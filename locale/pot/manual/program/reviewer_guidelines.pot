This process of building awareness is analogous to what happens when we step on the clutch in a manual-transmission automobile. The motor doesn't stop running (bias doesn't stop), but the car is no longer moving forward. When we are on the lookout for our biases, they are less likely to blindly dictate our decisions. |ref_6|_"

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:146
msgid "The Abstract: occasionally a title comes along that is so compelling that I have to remind myself to keep reading before voting +1 and moving on to the next talk. It isn't enough for a proposal to cover an interesting topic. It has to indicate that the talk will be interesting, too. While I am reading, I look for several factors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:148
msgid "**Is the abstract clear?** The speaker should describe the topic they plan to talk about in terms I can understand, even if I don't know anything about that subject area. A clearly written abstract, without a lot of domain-specific jargon, tells me the speaker will be able to communicate with the audience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:150
msgid "**Is the abstract complete?** An incomplete proposal is the largest negative factor I consider. If a proposal is incomplete, I can't really say what the speaker will talk about, or even if they know the subject matter for their talk. If a proposal does not have a detailed summary or outline, I as the submitter to provide more detail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:152
msgid "**Is the abstract compelling?** Without regard to the actual subject, is the abstract written in a way to attract an audience? I look for an abstract that shows the speaker is excited about the topic, and that they will be conveying that same excitement to the audience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:154
msgid "The Topic: for some people, the subject matter of a talk is the most important, or only, aspect taken into consideration when voting. I have seen presentations on topics I thought would be boring, but which were delivered with such enthusiasm that I enjoyed them more than talks I thought would be interesting from the outset. In my mind, the topic is an important factor, but not necessarily the most important, to be considered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:156
msgid "**How relevant, immediately useful and novel is the topic?** I look first at whether the topic is relevant to the conference attendees. Attendees will have a range of experience levels, interests, and backgrounds. Although we want a broad set of topics, we do need to be careful to avoid talks that are too narrowly focused on a niche. I often recommend that new projects which show a lot of promise convert their talk proposal into a poster proposal. As a counterpoint to considering whether a topic is too niche, I also try to take into account whether the audience will take away something immediately useful."

Conflict of Interest (COI) is different from individual bias. It is concerned with independence from any interest that could impair your objective assessment, any concern other than the intellectual quality of the work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/program/reviewer_guidelines.rst:168
msgid "As a reviewer, your present or previous association with certain authors poses textbook COI: recent collaborators in research funding or publications (in the past 4 years), family members, business partners, and thesis student/advisor or mentor. Other associations could be more tenuous: being employed by the same institution, for example. In this case, your obligation as reviewer is to disclose the potential COI to the area chair or Program Chair, and state whether you think you are able to make an impartial assessment of the work."
