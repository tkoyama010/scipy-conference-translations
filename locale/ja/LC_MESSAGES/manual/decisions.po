"This document is intended as a guide for newer contributors to the SciPy "
"Conference.  Over the years we have developed a  way of working that has "
"until now not been written down. At the central core of running the "
"conference is accepting the responsibility to your community to create an "
"open, inviting space for all to contribute.  With that said conflicts do "
"arise and here we outline the preferred way to mediate problems."

"If it’s a decision that affects other people, look for informal agreement "

msgid ""
"At it's core, SciPy has a hierarchy of decision processes.  Since the "
"conference is almost completely volunteer and we have strict deadlines to "
"adhere to, it is the job of the exectutive committee to help unblock folks "
"as quickly as possible.  Thus for each committee, the overseeing executive "
"chair is responsible for any decisions requiring consent from other "
"committees.  Furthermore, the chair is responsible for conflicts that arise."
"  The executive committee provides oversight for the individual committees "
"and Enthought's leadership provides oversight for the executive committee."

"Typically, the committee chair will try to find consensus for any decision "
"made. On some occasions the chair might need to make a quick decision or one"
" that goes against their committee due to extraneous situations, e.g. the "
"group decides to pay for everyone's lunch but the financial chair has no "
"room in the budget."

"“Getting consensus” does not mean that every member of the group has to "

"Anyone who cares about the decision has had the option of being part of the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/decisions.rst:31
msgid ""
"“Being part of the consensus process” means that everyone participating who "
"wants to make their opinion heard can do so. Ideally discussion focuses on "
"clarifying disagreement and seeking compromise. The outcome of a consensus "
"discussion is a proposal (often this is the initial proposal that began the "
"discussion, but is also frequently a modified or alternative proposal). The "
"group should aim to make sure discussion is finished before bringing the "
"proposal to a vote."
msgstr ""

#: ../../scipy-conference/manual/decisions.rst:33
msgid ""
"Participants are asked to vote for or against, abstain, or block the "
"proposal. Some threshold/percentage of for vs against votes, pre-determined "
"by the group, ensures the proposal’s passage."

msgid ""
"When a proposal is blocked, a second round of consensus-seeking occurs, with"
" the goal of formulating a new proposal that addresses the blocker’s "
"objections. Members of the group who had not been participating may be made "
"aware of the seriousness of the disagreement. After discussion, another vote"
" happens."
