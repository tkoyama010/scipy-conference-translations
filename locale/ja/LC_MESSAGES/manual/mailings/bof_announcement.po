"In an effort to increase the opportunities for community building, SciPy "
"emphasizes birds of a feather (BoFs) sessions. These sessions usually "
"include short presentations by a panel and a moderator with the bulk of the "
"time spent opening up the discussion to everyone in attendance. BoF topics "
"can be of general interest, such as state-of-the-project BoFs, or based on "
"the themes of the conference and the mini-symposia topics."
