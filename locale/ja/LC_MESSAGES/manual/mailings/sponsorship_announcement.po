"SciPy 2014 will continue the tradition of offering sponsorships to attend "
"the conference.  These sponsorships can provide funding for airfare, "
"lodging, and conference registration.  Like last year, these sponsorships "
"will be open to community members and students."

"Applications will be judged both on merit as well as need.  Although all "
"attendees are eligible for sponsorships, we encourage applicants to consider"
" their level of need before applying, such as whether their institution is "
"covering some or all of their travel costs.  As funds are limited, our goal "
"is to bring together as many SciPy community members as possible.  If only "
"partial sponsorship is required, please indicate this in the application and"
" we may be able to accommodate additional applicants due to such reasonable "
"requests."
