"The thirteenth annual Scientific Python conference, SciPy 2014, will be held"
" in July in Austin, TX. The SciPy community knows that the more people who "
"are involved in scientific problem-solving, the better off we all will be "
"because the diversity of perspectives leads to a diversity of solutions. "
"Therefore, in an effort to increase the diversity, as well as the pool of "
"people who are able to attend the conference, there are now an additional 5 "
"funding opportunities available, thanks to generous support from NumFOCUS. "
"To apply for this funding, supply the information indicated on the financial"
" aid application site ([finaid]_)."
