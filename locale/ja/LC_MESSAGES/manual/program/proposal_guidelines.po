"Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your description. "
"This should be a roughly 500-word outline of your presentation. This outline"

"tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how scientific Python "
"was applied to solve a research problem. A traditional "
"background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is "
