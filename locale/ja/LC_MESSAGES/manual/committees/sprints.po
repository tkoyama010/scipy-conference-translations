"Some time after the conference announcement, send out a call for submissions"

"anyone can submit a sprint proposal.  Sprint proposals should be brief: a "
"few sentences about the project and the goals of the sprint."

"In the conference schedule, ensure that there are times and locations "

"Sprints should be inclusive and proposals should generally be approved.The "
"submission form on the website was moderated, but mainly to prevent spam.  "
"In the case of two sprint proposals which are very close in nature, it may "

"Rooms for sprinters need to be set up with desks and power strips.  Open "

"At the AT&T Conference Center at UT in Austin, rooms 103, 104, 107 and 108 "

"After an introduction, the sprint co-chairs should invite sprint "
"coordinators to briefly describe their aims for the sprint, and perhaps how "
"sprinters may be able to contribute.  These descriptions should not require "

"Following this, get a feel for the size of each sprint by show of hands.  "
"This should allow the co-chairs to start to sketch out a distribution of "
"sprints in the available spaces.  Several sprints can usually share a room, "
"and co-chairs should endeavour to ensure that groups which may have "
"synergies are in the same room, as much as possible.  Listen to sprint "
