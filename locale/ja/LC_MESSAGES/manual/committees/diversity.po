"Andy Terrel and Kristen Thyng got funding from PSF and NumFOCUS to put on a "
"Women in Scientific Computing BOF. It was held at the AT&T center and 16 "
"people attended. It was in the evening and had some appetizers and drinks "
"available, and was at the same time as some other evening events. People "
"chatted for awhile, and then we sat together in a circle discussing women in"
" scientific computing. The event was free. "

"A diversity committee was established to plan an event: Patricia Francis-"
"Lyon, Katy Huff, Leah Silen, and Kristen Thyng. Funding was given by "
"NumFOCUS to help sponsor the event: $500 for the lunch, $500 for the "
"speaker, and $5000 for funding 5 diverse attendees for the conference. "
"People attending the Diversity in Scientific Computing lunch had to reserve "
"their place when registering and pay $10, in order to try to ensure people "
"would actually attend (this seems to have worked pretty well). The lunch was"
" in a private room at El Mercado and was scheduled for one hour and fifteen "
"minutes. The location was very close to the conference center. The lunch "
"seems to have been too short between people walking over to the lunch, "
"sitting down, having time to chat, having a speaker (she spoke for maybe 30 "
"minutes?), and having discussion afterward (no more than 10 minutes were "
"available for discussion). There was also more interest in the event than "
"there was capacity: there were tickets for 50 people and they sold out at "
"some point (not sure how early on). https://andy.terrel.us/blog/2014/07/17/ "

"At SciPy conferences in the past, like many conferences in areas in which "
"women have traditionally been underrepresented, women have made up a small "
"number of the participants. Last year, an official SciPy Women in Scientific"
" Computing event was held in an effort to start to understand what "
"roadblocks are in place that could be cleared to increase female "
"participation at the conference. The event was successful with many of the "
"women at the conference attending and productive discussion."

"This year, we propose to hold a lunch during the conference week for female "
"participants and other interested attendees. The lunch would include a meal "
"in a private dining room at a local restaurant near the conference center, "
"and a speaker would provide some thoughts. This lunch would be an "
"opportunity for women in scientific computing to build a network and find "
"people with common interests ­­ something that was specifically mentioned at"
" last year’s event as lacking for women in computing. As part of this event,"
" we would work to help formalize that network through an email list, to ease"
" the process of keeping in touch after the event. Additionally, we would "
"provide NumFOCUS with a summary of the event, and we would invite a NumFOCUS"
" presence at the event, as well."

"In addition to the event itself, we would like to extend the financial aid "
"options that are currently available to all participants in order to have a "
"focused effort to bring female participants to the conference. Last year, it"
" was noted that financial difficulties were a substantial problem for "
"getting to the conference in the first place. To address this problem, we "
"propose to offer a small number of scholarships for women to attend the "
"conference."
