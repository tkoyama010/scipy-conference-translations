"Welcome, O' hearty soul, to the communications team! Your task will be "
"difficult, frustrating, annoying, and ultimately extraordinarily rewarding."
"  This position is on-par with the program committee, placing it one rung "
"below the conference chairs."

"As a chair of the communications team, you are the public face of the "
"conference. However, more importantly, **you are the representative of the "
"community to the other organizers!** Your job is to advocate for all members"
" of the community, equally."

"Communication is a two-way street.  It is your job to make sure that both of"
" these avenues remain open and positive for the entirety of the conference "
"and its organization.  Often, this requires putting aside your own personal "
"feelings about an issue."

"In many cases, you will need to step in and act as an official mediator "
"between organizers, the community and organizers, or other vested parties.  "
"Because of this you will often be involved in touchy issues.  It is "
"therefore *extremely* advantageous to be strong friends with the other top "
"brass.  Additionally, always make it very clear when you are acting as the "
"\"Communications Chair\" on behalf of the conference rather than as an "
"individual.  People you don't know will nominally defer to the conference "
"authority as long as they feel that their grievances are being heard (your "
"job).  Your friends and fellow organizers will understand that they are "
"putting you in an uncomfortable situation that they themselves don't wish to"
" have.  By listening and making your role clear, you should be able to "
"diffuse and resolve most sensitive topics."
