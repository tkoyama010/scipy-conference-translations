"One idea for this would be to outsource to Software Carpentry, but it's not "

"In 2015 we did have a Software Carpentry track for 2 days to try to reach "
"out to people who are truly new. This worked pretty well: there were reports"
" of fewer newbies in the lower level tutorials and the SC tutorial went "
"well, but it wasn't very well attended. We think this is still a good idea, "
"but needs to be advertised better and to be possibly broken into 4 hour "
"chunks like the other tutorials instead of keeping people in the track the "
"whole time."
